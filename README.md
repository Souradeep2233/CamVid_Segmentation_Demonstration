This repository includes implementations of deep learning models using PyTorch for tasks such as semantic segmentation on CamVid data, an approach to segment streets and  other driving necessities on the road, useful for self-driving vehicles, and automobile intelligence.

## 📂 Contents

* `camvid-segmentation.ipynb`
  Implementation of semantic segmentation using the CamVid dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* PyTorch
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Torchvision

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Souradeep2233/DL_5thsem.git
cd DL_5thsem
```

### (Optional) Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Dependencies

If you have a `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually install:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy
```

### Run Notebooks

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the `camvid-segmentation.ipynb` file to start exploring the project.

## 🧲 Dataset

The CamVid dataset is required for training and evaluation. Download it from [CamVid Dataset](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/VideoRec/CamVid/) and place it in a folder structured as expected by the notebook.

## 📁 Project Structure
