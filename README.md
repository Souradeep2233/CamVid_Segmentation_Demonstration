# 🧠 CamVid Segmentation Demonstration

This repository contains practical assignments and projects developed as part of the Deep Learning course during the 5th semester. It includes implementations of deep learning models using PyTorch for tasks such as semantic segmentation.

## 📂 Contents

* `camvid-segmentation.ipynb`
  Implementation of semantic segmentation using the CamVid dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* PyTorch
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Torchvision

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Souradeep2233/DL_5thsem.git
cd DL_5thsem
```

### (Optional) Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Dependencies

If you have a `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually install:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy
```

### Run Notebooks

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the `camvid-segmentation.ipynb` file to start exploring the project.

## 🧲 Dataset

The CamVid dataset is required for training and evaluation. Download it from [CamVid Dataset](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/VideoRec/CamVid/) and place it in a folder structured as expected by the notebook.

## 📁 Project Structure

```

├── camvid-segmentation.ipynb
├── requirements.txt        # (Optional)
└── README.md
```

## 📌 Future Work

* Add more assignments and practicals from the course
* Extend segmentation experiments to other datasets (e.g., Cityscapes)
* Add support for custom training pipelines
